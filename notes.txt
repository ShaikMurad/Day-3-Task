JSON iterate over all for loops (for, for in, for of, forEach)

Looping Using JSON:

JSON stands for javascript object Notation. It’s a light format for storing and transferring data from one place to another. So in looping. It is one of the most commonly used techniques for transporting data that is the array format or in attribute values.

For Loop:
The for loop comes first because of its simplicity and ease of use. It is a very user friendly kind of loop that runs with a method of using a counter. The for loop makes things really easy when you need to run a set of codes multiple times.

For IN:
Another way of looping is the For In Loop. Unlike the For Loop, this loop won’t be using a counter. So this makes the whole process even more simple and hassle-free. In fact. The for in loop is essentially as simplified version of the for loop.

ForEach:
This method is used for looping through an array element. Here’s an example
JSON Resume:
1.	age: 25
2.	experience: "5 years experience in Title"
3.	father_name: "SJ Zikriya"
4.	gender: "male"
5.	languages_known: (4) ['Tamil', 'Telugu', 'English', 'Hindi']
6.	location: "Chittoor"
7.	mother_name: "S J Chotima"
8.	name: "S Murad"
9.	qualification: (3) ['SSC', 'Inter', 'B.Com(Computer Application)']
10.	[[Prototype]]: Object

Difference between window, screen and document:
The window is the actual global object. The screen is the screen, it contains properties about the user’s display. The document is where the DOM is document can also be window.
A document is an object inside the window object and we use a document object for manipulation inside the document. The first thing that gets loaded into the browser is the window and the properties related to that window are stored in the window object.
